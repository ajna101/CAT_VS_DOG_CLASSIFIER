# CAT_VS_DOG_CLASSIFIER
This project uses CNNs and TensorFlow to build an AI model for precise cat vs. dog image classification. It involves data preprocessing, normalization, and CNN architecture with pooling layers to learn patterns from images. Overfitting was addressed using "BatchNormalization" and "Dropout," enhancing generalization.

Usage
To run the project, download the "dogs-vs-cats" dataset from Kaggle and upload the "kaggle.json" file to the ".kaggle" directory. Execute the Jupyter Notebook to follow the step-by-step implementation of the project.

Feel free to experiment with the code and explore different parameters to further enhance the model's performance.

Acknowledgments
I would like to express my gratitude to the data science community for their inspiration and support throughout this exciting project journey.

Let's learn together and make a profound impact in the world of AI and data science! ðŸš€ðŸŒ±

For detailed code implementation, please refer to the "Untitled33.ipynb" notebook in this repository.

Note: Please ensure you have the necessary libraries installed before running the project. The accuracy and performance of the model may vary based on your hardware and data preprocessing choices.
