# CAT_VS_DOG_CLASSIFIER
This project uses CNNs and TensorFlow to build an AI model for precise cat vs. dog image classification. It involves data preprocessing, normalization, and CNN architecture with pooling layers to learn patterns from images. Overfitting was addressed using "BatchNormalization" and "Dropout," enhancing generalization.
